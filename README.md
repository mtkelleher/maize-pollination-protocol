# Maize Pollination Protocol
Written by Micah Kelleher

A typical day of maize pollination and preparation involves three main tasks: shoot bagging, pollination, and setting up pollinations for the following day.

## Background: Maize Flower Biology

Maize (*Zea mays*) is a monoecious plant, meaning that each individual contains both male and female reproductive organs. However, these organs are contained in imperfect, or unisexual, flowers.   The male flowers are located in the tassel at the top of the plant. Tassels produce pollen, which is released from structures called anthers. Each tassel consists of many small units called spikelets, each containing two florets enclosed by two glumes. Inside each floret are three anthers, attached to fine filaments. As the florets mature, the anthers emerge and dangle from the tassel which releases pollen. This can be seen as a yellowish dust when the tassel is shaken or as a breeze blows through.

The female flowers grow lower on the plant and are commonly referred to as ears, but we refer to these as the shoots. These develop within the leaf axils, which are between the junction of the leaf sheath and the stalk. Each ear contains many ovules, or potential kernels, in which a silk emerges. The silk is part stigma and part style. It captures pollen and brings it down to the ovule for fertilization. Each successfully pollinated silk results in one kernel on the cob.

## Shoot Bagging

Shoot bagging can be done at any time during the day, but it is the first step in controlled pollination. It is often done after the morning's pollinations are complete, though it can also be done beforehand while waiting for moisture to dry from the bags. Shoot bags, which are made of waxy paper, are placed over shoots on the plants that will receive pollen. The longer flap, or tongue, should be positioned against the stalk. To secure the bag and prevent it from being dislodged by wind, pull it downward firmly. We typically focus on the top three uncontaminated ears per plant. If silks have already emerged from a shoot, it is considered contaminated and should not be bagged.

## Pollinating

Pollination is performed in the morning using the tassel bags and shoots that were set up the previous day. We typically pollinate between 8:00 AM and 1:00 PM. This allows time for moisture to evaporate and avoids the high heat later in the day (especially above 95°F). If nighttime lows reach 55°F or lower, viable pollen may still be available, but it’s best to wait until a few hours into the day for better shedding conditions. High humidity can also hinder pollen shedding. It should also be noted that pollen submerged in water is no longer viable, so moisture on the tassel or shoot bags should be avoided.

Pollen generally remains viable for about 20 minutes after leaving the anther. In hot, dry conditions this can be reduced to 10 minutes or less. In cool, humid weather, it may survive 30 minutes to several hours. For this reason, we bag tassels the day before, ensuring that any unwanted pollen on the tassel will no longer be viable the next morning.

To collect pollen, bend the plant so that the tassel bag’s opening is horizontal or slightly upward to prevent pollen from spilling out. Tap and shake the bag gently to release the pollen, then immediately walk it to the receiving plant.  
You may lean the plant receiving the pollen to avoid accidental contamination by stray pollen. Remove the shoot bag from the ear and pour the pollen directly onto the exposed silks. You can channel the pollen using a crease or corner of the tassel bag for better control. It should be noted that the pollen, which is dust-like, should be poured onto the silks, not then anthers alone. For self pollination, you may reuse the tassel bag to cover the ear once pollinated. For cross-pollination, use a new bag labeled with the female row x male row. For a self, write the row number and draw a circle with an "X" through it. Always include the date and source row(s) on the bag.

- (B) Ear being pollinated with anthers contacting silks. Anthers can make contact with the silks, but they will not ensure pollination.
- (C) Ear being pollinated without anthers contacting silks. Pollen can be poured onto the silks without including anthers, which can help ensure contact.

After pollination, cover the ear with the labeled bag, wrap it around the stalk, and secure it with staples. Pre-labeling the tassel bag is ideal, but if more time is needed, the shoot bag can be placed back over the ear. However, this may not be ideal if the shoot bag is very wet.

## Setting Up Pollinations

To set up for the next day’s pollination, check that the tassels on donor plants are shedding and that the recipient shoots have silks. We usually focus on the highest uncontaminated ear. Only one ear is typically pollinated per plant to maximize kernel development.

Remove the shoot bag of the recipient. Before cutting, feel for the location of the ear to avoid cutting into it. Using shears, trim the top of the shoot to expose the silks. This maximizes the number of silks that will be able to receive pollen. If no silks are visible after trimming, the ear is likely not ready or wasn’t trimmed down enough.

If the shoot is trimmed and silks are present, replace the shoot bag immediately and fold the top edge outward and away from the stalk. Mark the fold with an "X" if it was set up on an even date and an "O" if on an odd date. This helps pollinators easily identify set up ears. It may also be helpful to keep track of how many plants are set up in each row and communicate that to the next day's team.

- (A) Shoot cut back properly with silks exposed.
- (B) Shoot cut back with no silks visible. In this case it was cut prematurely.
- (C) Shoot cut too far, slightly into the cob. It can still be pollinated, but not ideal.

Next, cover the tassel of the pollen donor plant with a labeled tassel bag. Include the date and row number. Any pollen present at the time of bagging will not be viable the next day, and only newly shed pollen will be viable when pollinating.
